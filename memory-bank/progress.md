# Implementation Progress - Defend Your Farm

## Step 1: Basic React Component Structure ✅ (Completed April 7, 2025)

We've successfully implemented the first step of integrating Phaser.js with our React-based farm game:

1. **Created the Component Structure**:
   - Set up `components/farm-game/FarmGame.js`: A React component that renders the Phaser game canvas within our app's UI
   - Created `components/farm-game/scenes/GameScene.js`: The main Phaser scene that handles the game logic

2. **Added Game Initialization Logic**:
   - Used React's `useEffect` to initialize the Phaser game when the component mounts
   - Implemented dynamic imports for Phaser as it requires the window object which is only available client-side
   - Added proper cleanup when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks

3. **Set Up Data Flow Between React and Phaser**:
   - Created a mechanism to pass the farm coins data from React to Phaser
   - Implemented `addFarmCoins` callback to update the React state when coins are earned or spent in the game

4. **Integrated with Existing Farm Component**:
   - Imported and added the FarmGame component to the main farm.tsx file
   - Updated the UI to match our app's theme with dark backgrounds and white text

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Added Phaser.js (v3.88.2) to the project dependencies

6. **Fixed Server-Side Rendering Issues**:
   - Added 'use client' directive to ensure components are treated as client-side only
   - Implemented isMounted state to verify the component is mounted before accessing browser APIs
   - Added comprehensive error handling throughout the code
   - Added debug logging to help identify and fix issues

## Current Status and Next Steps

The Defend Your Farm game currently renders a basic UI with:
- A game canvas that displays "Farm Coins" and "Wave" information
- A start button that initializes the game state
- Implemented crop planting mechanics
- Added enemy movement and spawning

## Step 2: Core Game Mechanics ✅ (Completed April 7, 2025)

We've successfully implemented the core game mechanics:

1. **Implemented Crop Planting**:
   - Players can click on the game area to plant crops if they have sufficient farm coins
   - Each crop costs 5 coins to plant
   - Crops are positioned on a grid to keep the layout organized
   - Crops automatically generate income over time

2. **Added Enemy Spawning and Movement**:
   - Implemented enemy spawning system with wave-based progression
   - Created two enemy types: birds and rabbits, each with different properties
   - Enemies move from right to left across the screen
   - Players can click on enemies to damage and defeat them
   - Defeating enemies rewards the player with coins

3. **Game Loop and Wave Progression**:
   - Added wave system that increases difficulty over time
   - Automatic detection of wave completion
   - Increasing number of enemies in later waves

Next step (Step 3) will involve:
- Adding more defense options (scarecrows and dogs)
- Implementing player upgrades

## Step 3: Defense Options and Game Enhancements ✅ (Completed April 7, 2025)

We've successfully implemented additional defense options for the farm game:

1. **Added Defense Structures**:
   - Created a `Defense.js` entity class to support different types of defenses
   - Implemented two defense types:
     - **Scarecrows**: Effective against birds, with longer range (cost: 20 coins)
     - **Dogs**: Effective against rabbits, deal more damage (cost: 30 coins)
   - Added specialized attack animations and behaviors for each defense type

2. **Defense Placement System**:
   - Added defense placement buttons in the game UI
   - Implemented grid-based placement system for defenses (right side of screen only)
   - Added visual indicators showing valid placement locations
   - Enforced separation of defenses (crops on left, defenses on right)

3. **Defense Mechanics**:
   - Defenses automatically target and attack enemies that enter their range
   - Each defense has specific enemy types they can target
   - Implemented cooldown timers for balanced gameplay
   - Defenses apply damage to enemies and can defeat them

4. **Enhanced UI**:
   - Added defense selection UI with cost information
   - Added range indicators for placed defenses
   - Updated placement indicators to show if player has enough coins

5. **Game Balance**:
   - Adjusted costs for different defense types
   - Tuned defense range and damage values for balanced gameplay
   - Ensured the reset function clears all defenses

The implementation follows the planned design in the GDD, with defenses serving as automated protection that complement the player's direct interaction (clicking enemies).

Next step (Step 4) will involve:
- Implementing player upgrades (tools, defenses, crop yield)
- Adding a progression system (unlocking new defense types)

## Testing Notes

- Placement of defenses works correctly - only allowed on the right side of screen
- Each defense type correctly targets its intended enemy types
- Visual feedback makes it clear when and where defenses can be placed
- Reset functionality properly clears all defenses along with other game elements

## Issue Fixes

   - Developed a new `Upgrade.js` class to manage player upgrades
   - Added support for upgrading multiple game aspects (damage, yield, defenses)
   - Implemented maximum upgrade levels with increasing costs
   - Created an easy-to-use UI panel for purchasing upgrades

2. **Implemented Five Core Upgrade Types**:
   - **Click Damage**: Increases player's direct attack damage against enemies

   - **Scarecrow Power**: Enhances the damage dealt by scarecrow/ABS mage defenses
   - **Dog Power**: Improves the damage dealt by dog/NOOT mage defenses
   - **Crop Growth**: Accelerates the growth rate of planted crops

3. **Added Advanced Defense Unlocking System**:
   - Created a progression-based unlock system for advanced defenses
   - Added two new defense types: Wizard and Cannon (to be implemented in next step)
   - Set unlock requirements based on wave progression and coin cost
   - Added visual feedback when new defenses are unlocked

4. **Enhanced Existing Game Entities**:
   - Updated the Crop class to support yield and growth rate multipliers
   - Modified the Defense class to support damage multipliers
   - Ensured all upgrades provide immediate visual feedback
   - Made all upgrades persist until the game is reset

5. **Balanced Game Economy**:
   - Tuned upgrade costs to provide meaningful progression
   - Created scaling benefits that reward investment
   - Adjusted starting coins to 50 to allow immediate gameplay
   - Added wave completion bonuses to fund upgrades

6. **UI Improvements**:
   - Added an Upgrades panel that can be toggled with the gear icon
   - Created clear visual indicators showing upgrade costs and requirements

1. **Added Advanced Defense Options**:
   - **Wizard**: Long-ranged, versatile defense that can target all enemy types
     - Special attack: Chain lightning that jumps between multiple enemies
     - Higher damage but more expensive than basic defenses
     - Unlocks at wave 5 for 350 coins
   - **Cannon**: Heavy damage defense with massive area of effect
     - Special attack: Explosion that damages all enemies in a large radius
     - Longest range and highest damage of all defenses
     - Unlocks at wave 8 for 600 coins

2. **Implemented Fox Enemy Type**:
   - Stealthy and evasive enemy that appears from wave 3 onwards
   - Special ability: Can dodge attacks and temporarily enter stealth mode
   - Weak against wizard defenses
   - Higher health and speed compared to basic enemies

3. **Enhanced Defense Placement System**:
   - Added visual indicators for defense ranges and attack effects
   - Created distinctive attack animations for each defense type
   - Implemented cooldown indicators for all defenses

4. **Added Progression-Based Defense Unlocking**:
   - Defenses are initially locked and become available as player progresses
   - Implemented proper UI for viewing unlock requirements
   - Added notifications when new defenses become available

5. **Balanced Gameplay**:
   - Adjusted enemy spawn rates to gradually introduce fox enemies
   - Fine-tuned defense costs and damage values
