Missing Sound Files for Defend Your Farm

Based on SoundManager.js, the following sound files need to be created or properly renamed:

1. `coins.mp3` - Exists but needs to be verified
2. `error.mp3` - May need to be created or renamed
3. `enemy_hit.mp3` - Exists but may need to be checked for compatibility
4. `defense_placed.mp3` - Exists but has a duplicate with "копия" in the name

All remaining sound files appear to be in place, but should be tested in-game to ensure they work correctly and have appropriate volumes.
